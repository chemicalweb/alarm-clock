## Alarm Clock

This is just a simple shell script that acts as an alarm clock. A natural consequence of my habit of sleeping on the laptop! So nothing seemed better than turning my laptop into an alarm clock to wake me up. Currently this works on a Linux system and needs `mplayer` to be installed.

#### To Use
Download all the scripts and run the following in a terminal:

`./alarm.sh`

In the `buzzer.sh` file change the `file` variable. To change the snooze time change the `snooze` variable in the file `alarm.sh`.
